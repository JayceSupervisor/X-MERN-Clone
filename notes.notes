- Following/Follwer explanation
- FOLLOW: Two users with two ids are created as John and Jane. John is id1 and Jane is #2.
- John follows Jane, Jane will get a follower (John) and get added to the followers array of Jane.
- Since John now follows Jane, the id of Jane will be added to the following array of John and vice versa.
- UNFOLLOW: If John unfollows Jane, John id will be removed from the followers array of Jane and Jane will be removed from the following array of John.
- This applies to multiple users as well and the same logic is applied using different ids.
- This method is applied using push and pull methods of MongoDB. Push to add and pull to remove.

- Suggested users will return a list of users that are not followed by the user. This is done by finding all users that are not in the following array of the user. Users that are already followed will not be shown in the suggested users list.
